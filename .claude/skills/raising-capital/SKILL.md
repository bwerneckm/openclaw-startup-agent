# Skill: Fundraising & Investor Relations

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Preparing to raise a new round or building/refining a pitch deck
- Setting up or updating an investor pipeline/CRM
- Writing monthly investor updates (pre-raise or post-raise)
- Preparing a data room for due diligence
- Analyzing pass reasons to improve pitch and positioning
- Negotiating term sheets, SAFEs, or priced rounds

## Framework Stack

```
Phase 1: SEQUOIA 10-SLIDE + HOFFMAN ANALOGY  (deck)          -> "What story are we telling?"
Phase 2: PG + NFX PROCESS                    (execution)     -> "How do we run the raise?"
Phase 3: SUSTER "LINES NOT DOTS"             (relationships) -> "How do we build trust?"
Phase 4: MONTHLY INVESTOR UPDATES            (ongoing)       -> "How do we keep investors warm?"
Phase 5: SAFE / ROUND STRUCTURE              (closing)       -> "How do we close the deal?"
```

## Phase 1: Fundraising Deck -- Sequoia 10-Slide Format + Hoffman Analogy

### Company Positioning (resolve before building any slide)

- DO: Lead with the end-customer value proposition and product differentiation
- DO NOT: Lead with underlying technology or infrastructure terminology that investors won't immediately grasp
- Articulate how you solve a problem, not just what technology you use
- For tone/copywriting: reference the **building-brand** skill.

> **Positioning Trap:** Many technical founders default to describing their stack ("[Positioning A]") instead
> of their market impact ("[Positioning B]"). Investors buy outcomes. Frame your pitch around the outcome.

### Hoffman Analogy

Pick ONE and use consistently in every meeting (goes on Slide 2 as subheadline):
- "[Known Company] for [your market]" -- choose the analogy that resonates most with your investor audience
- Example patterns: "Stripe for [X]", "Plaid for [X]", "Shopify for [X]"

Test 2-3 analogies in early meetings and converge on whichever gets the fastest "aha" reaction.

### Slide-by-Slide Guide

| # | Slide | Core Question | Content Prompts |
|---|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Problem** | Why does this matter? | Quantify the pain: cost, time, complexity of the status quo. Name specific incumbent solutions and their limitations. Use a real customer proof point if available. |
| 2 | **Solution** | What do you do? | One sentence + architecture diagram. Show input (customer) -> your platform -> output (value delivered). Highlight time-to-value vs. status quo. |
| 3 | **Why Now** | Why this moment? | Market tailwinds, regulatory shifts, technology inflection points, behavioral changes. Cite recent data or events that make the timing urgent. |
| 4 | **Market Size** | How big? | TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up math. Show geographic or vertical expansion path. Use **modeling-finances** skill for projections. |
| 5 | **Competition** | Why will you win? | 2x2 positioning map showing your unique quadrant. Address each competitor category: incumbents, adjacent players, DIY/in-house. Explain your moat. |
| 6 | **Product** | What have you built? | Demo flow, sandbox, time-to-first-hello-world. Reference your product roadmap. Show what's live vs. what's planned. |
| 7 | **Business Model** | How do you make money? | Revenue model, unit economics, average revenue per client, gross margin. Show path to target ARR. Use **modeling-finances** skill. |
| 8 | **Team** | Why this team? | Lead with the strongest credential in the first 2 minutes. [Founder/CEO]: headline experience. [Founder/CTO]: technical depth. Other key hires. Emphasize domain expertise and founder-market fit. |
| 9 | **Financials** | What are the numbers? | Year 1/2/3 projections: ARR, client count, volume. Pull from your financial models. Use **modeling-finances** for scenarios. |
| 10 | **The Ask** | What do you need? | $[X]M [SAFE/Priced]. Use of funds: Eng [X%], Sales [X%], Ops [X%]. BE CONSISTENT -- same number every meeting (pre-seed pass lesson). Milestones this capital unlocks. |

## Phase 2: Fundraising Process -- PG + NFX Execution

### Paul Graham's Rules

1. Only raise when you have a story and signal in the market.
2. "Default alive" startups negotiate from strength (use **modeling-finances** skill).
3. Optimize for right partner and speed, not maximum valuation.
4. Get the first commitment -- hardest dollar is the first. Then FOMO works for you.
5. Close committed money within 48 hours. Do not let it cool.

### NFX Raise Execution Plan

```
PRE-RAISE (4-6 weeks before)
  [ ] Monthly updates sent to targets for 3+ months (Phase 4)
  [ ] Deck finalized and rehearsed
  [ ] Data room complete (checklist below)
  [ ] 20-30 investors in pipeline CRM
  [ ] Warm intros in batches of 5-8/week
  [ ] Practice pitch 5-10x with friendlies

WEEKS 1-2: LAUNCH
  [ ] All intro requests sent within 2-week window
  [ ] 3-5 first meetings per week
  [ ] Debrief after every meeting -- adjust pitch

WEEKS 3-4: MOMENTUM
  [ ] Follow up within 48 hours of every meeting
  [ ] Share traction updates with pipeline
  [ ] Prioritize most likely lead's diligence

WEEKS 5-6: CLOSE
  [ ] First term sheet -> leverage for others
  [ ] Deadline for undecided: "Closing in 2 weeks"
  [ ] Negotiate terms (Phase 5), sign SAFEs, collect wires

POST-CLOSE
  [ ] Announce to all investors (including passes)
  [ ] Thank intro-makers
  [ ] Transition everyone to monthly update cadence
```

**Critical rule:** Never stop fundraising. Even between rounds, maintain relationship cadence (Phase 3) and monthly updates (Phase 4).

---

## Phase 3: Relationship Building -- Suster "Lines Not Dots"

A single meeting is a dot. Multiple touchpoints over 6-12 months create a line showing momentum. Build relationships months before the ask.

### Touchpoint Cadence

**Months 1-3:** Add targets to monthly update list. Engage with their content. Share industry insights with no ask. Request 15-min advice calls on topics they know (not disguised pitches).

**Months 4-6:** Share milestones unprompted. Introduce them to people in their interest area. Congratulate portfolio wins.

**Months 7+:** They have 6+ data points. The ask meeting feels natural, not transactional.

Log every touchpoint in the investor's Pipeline CRM record: `[DATE] - [Action] - [Response]`

---

## Phase 4: Monthly Investor Updates

### Template

```
SUBJECT: [YOUR_COMPANY] -- [Month] [Year] Update

1. WINS & MILESTONES (top 3 things that went well)
   - [Win 1]: [One sentence]
   - [Win 2]: [One sentence]
   - [Win 3]: [One sentence]

2. KEY METRICS (same table every month -- trend lines matter)
   | Metric              | Last Month | This Month | Change |
   |---------------------|------------|------------|--------|
   | Clients (live)      | [N]        | [N]        | [+/-]  |
   | Monthly volume      | $[X]       | $[X]       | [+/-%] |
   | MRR                 | $[X]       | $[X]       | [+/-%] |
   | Products live       | [N]        | [N]        | [+/-]  |
   | Pipeline (in talks) | [N]        | [N]        | [+/-]  |
   | Runway (months)     | [N]        | [N]        | [+/-]  |

3. THE ASK (max 2, be specific -- names not categories)
   - "Looking for intros to: [Company A], [Company B]"
   - "Hiring: [Role] -- know any [specific profile] in [region]?"

4. LEARNINGS (one honest insight -- never hide bad news)
   - "We learned [X] -- adjusting by [Y]"

5. NEXT MONTH (3 priorities)
   - Priority 1: [Specific]
   - Priority 2: [Specific]
   - Priority 3: [Specific]
```

### Rules

- Same day each month. Consistency builds trust.
- Under 500 words. Investors scan.
- Same metric table every month. Trend lines over snapshots.
- Send even when news is bad. Silence is worse.
- BCC prospective investors, CC current investors.
- For metric definitions: reference the **measuring-growth** skill.

## Phase 5: Closing -- SAFE / Round Structure

### SAFE vs. Priced Round

| Factor | SAFE | Priced Round |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Speed | 1-2 days legal | 2-4 weeks |
| Legal cost | $0-5K | $25-75K |
| Valuation | Deferred (cap + discount) | Immediate (price/share) |
| Board seats | None | Typically 1 |
| Best when | Pre-seed/seed, < $3M | Series A+, governance needed |

### Valuation Anchoring

```
VALUATION PREP
  1. Comparable rounds: 5-10 recent rounds in category
     | Company | Stage | Amount | Valuation | Date | Relevance |
  2. Your anchors: Floor $[X]M | Target $[X]M | Stretch $[X]M | Walk-away $[X]M
  3. Justification: "Our pre-seed closed at $[X]. Given [milestones], $[Y] reflects progress."
  4. Dilution: At $[X]M val + $[Y]M raise = [Z%] dilution. Model with modeling-finances skill.
```

### Term Sheet Comparison

When comparing multiple offers, evaluate side by side:

| Term | Offer A | Offer B | Offer C |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Investor | [Name] | [Name] | [Name] |
| Amount | $[X]M | $[X]M | $[X]M |
| Instrument | [SAFE/Priced] | [SAFE/Priced] | [SAFE/Priced] |
| Valuation cap | $[X]M | $[X]M | $[X]M |
| Discount | [X%] | [X%] | [X%] |
| Pro-rata / Board / MFN | [Y/N each] | [Y/N each] | [Y/N each] |
| Strategic value | [Details] | [Details] | [Details] |
| Decision speed | [Fast/Slow] | [Fast/Slow] | [Fast/Slow] |

### Negotiation Sequence

1. Lead investor first -- set the terms. 2. Fill with followers on same terms (or MFN). 3. Each conversation is private. 4. Soft deadlines: "Closing by [DATE]."

---

## Investor Pipeline CRM

### Stages

1. **Research** -- Identified, no contact. Research thesis fit, check size, conflicts, intro path. (1-3 days)
2. **Intro Request** -- Warm intro sent or cold outreach. (3-7 days)
3. **First Meeting** -- Pitch completed, next step defined. (1-2 weeks)
4. **Follow-up / Diligence** -- Data room sent, questions answered, partner meetings. (2-4 weeks)
5. **Term Sheet** -- Terms received, negotiating. (1-2 weeks)
6. **Closed** -- Signed, wire received.
7. **Passed** -- Record in Pass Analysis Template. Set follow-up trigger for next round.

### Investor Record

```
INVESTOR: [Fund Name]
Contact: [Partner, title] | Fund: $[X]M | Check: $[X]K-$[X]M | Stage focus: [Pre-seed/Seed/A]
Thesis fit: [1-2 sentences] | Conflicts: [Any] | Intro path: [Who]
Current stage: [1-7] | Follow-up cadence: [Active: weekly | Warm: monthly update]

Meeting log:
  [DATE] - [Type] - [Takeaway] - [Next step]
```

### Pipeline Health (track weekly during active raise)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Total in pipeline | 20-30 |
| First meetings/week | 3-5 |
| Conversion: Meeting->Follow-up | > 50% |
| Conversion: Follow-up->Term Sheet | > 20% |
| Days Stage 3->4 | < 14 |

## Pass Analysis

### Individual Pass Record

```
PASS RECORD: [Fund Name]
Partner: [Name] | Stage reached: [1-6] | Date: [DATE] | Type: [Explicit / Ghosted / "Not now"]

Reason (their words): "[Direct quote]"

Tags: [ ] Valuation [ ] Insufficient traction [ ] Market timing [ ] Competitive concern
      [ ] GTM clarity [ ] PMF uncertainty [ ] Team gap [ ] Thesis mismatch
      [ ] Check size [ ] Portfolio conflict [ ] Geographic mismatch

Preventable? [Y/N] -- [What would have changed outcome]
Pattern match: [Which other passes share this reason]
Follow-up trigger: [e.g., "When we hit $500K ARR" / "Next round"]
Add to monthly updates: [Y/N]
Lesson: [One sentence]
```

### Common Pre-Seed Pass Patterns

| Pattern | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| "Want more data points" | Pre-product, no live clients | Monthly updates (Phase 4) build the "line." Raise from regional/angel investors first, return with data for institutional seed. |
| "Valuation too high" | Valuation did not match GTM/product maturity | Use Valuation Anchoring (Phase 5). Show clear path to $1M+ ARR. Strengthen moat narrative vs. adjacent competitors. |
| "Customer concentration risk" | Large players build in-house, leaving only small clients | Address in Competition slide: "Even large clients won't build N products themselves." Show land-and-expand where ARPA grows with products added. |
| "Inconsistent messaging" | Different amounts, positioning, analogies across meetings | Standardize: one number, one analogy, one GTM story. VCs talk to each other. |

### Quarterly Pass Review

Every quarter: tally passes by stage, identify top 3 reason tags, document pitch changes made, set open questions for next quarter.
